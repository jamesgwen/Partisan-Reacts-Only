# Partisan Reacts Only

This project was done in the winter of 2018. The goal was to address partisan bias on Twitter by looking at Tweets from US Senators. 

The following is the abstract of the paper:

Much of the political research concerning Twitter in the United States has been related to
partisanship or campaigns. Recently, more attention has been paid to Twitter metrics such as
replies, retweets, and favorites. Retweets and favorites are generally affirmations of a tweet
while replies have been shown to express disagreement with a tweet. As such, a tweet with a
higher retweet to reply ratio or a higher favorite to reply ratio shows approval of the message in
the tweet. Our data assessed tweets from US senators in 2017. We found that the ratio of
retweets to replies and favorites to replies was higher for Democrats compared to Republicans
and that the difference is greater when comparing more ideologically extreme senators of both
parties.
